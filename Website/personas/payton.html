                    Payton, a 34 year old woman, is a Collegiate Swim Coach in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She manages the women's swim team at the University of Michigan, which serves as her primary career. Growing up in Indiana, Payton went to the University of Michigan to pursue a degree in Sports Administration. During her time at UMich, she swam on the swim team, leading her to become close with her coach and the athletics department at the school. She eventually returned to the school at 27 to become the team’s swim coach, where she’s been working ever since. <br><br>Payton is fairly familiar with modern smartphone applications, as she grew up around the time in which these programs first hit the market, and became popular. She might not have as well of an understanding of applications that have recently hit the market, as she’s begun to “age out” of these program’s target demographic. Aside from this general application experience, she isn’t very familiar with higher level computing and programming, may struggle with using an application with too many features, or a complicated UI.  <br><br>Payton has a deep connection with the UMich swim team, and wants the team to become as successful as possible. She uses StatTrackr to monitor each of her players strengths and weaknesses, in order to find the best players for each stroke. She also uses StatTrackr for its ability to compare her team’s times to other universities, in order to determine which strokes need extra practice, in order to help her players finish first.
