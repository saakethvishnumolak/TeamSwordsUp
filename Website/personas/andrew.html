    <p>
        Andrew Martin is a 20 year old man currently living in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He’s a Junior at the University of Alabama, studying Business Administration. Growing up in the suburbs right outside of Tuscaloosa, Andrew comes from a middle class family, and has been planning on attending Bama since he was a kid.  <br><br>In his free time, Andrew also plays for Alabama's men’s basketball team. He plays as a forward for the team, and while he isn’t the group’s star player, he’s good enough to be currently attending Bama on a basketball scholarship. Andrew has had years worth of experience as a forward, as he’s been playing ever since he was 15. <br><br>As a young adult, Andrew is incredibly familiar with smartphone applications, and can easily navigate through most commercial software. He’s confident in his ability to operate most modern day applications. However, he doesn’t have much experience in higher level computing, and may struggle with using an application with too many features, or a complicated UI. <br><br>Andrew is always striving to improve his performance, both among his teammates and other players in the NCAA. He uses StatTrackr not only because it keeps track of his gameplay statistics in an organized, easy to navigate interface, but because he can check his own progress against his peers and competition, making him ready for gameday.
