            <h3>Scenario One</h3>
            <p>
                After a training session, a player comes up to Eric asking if he could train him. Eric, like with all the new players gives him a free session and then also watches him play live beforehand to see what he is dealing with. He then checks the app to see his past stats and performances. This player played shortstop and he committed way too many errors over the past couple seasons. <br><br>
                Eric puts the player through multiple drills. Hitting ground balls and fast line outs to him to increase reaction time and technique. He then moves on to improve his throwing accuracy from shortstop to second and first base. He tracks progress as the season and training sessions continue to see how the player improves.

            <h3>Scenario Two</h3>
            <p>
                A standout Pitcher is recovering from Tommy John which he suffered a year ago. He was finally cleared and came to Eric to help get his velocity back. Eric begins by easing the pitcher back into things. This starts with a lot of plyometrics and hypertrophy work with a lot of band/resistance work. Add in cardio to get back in shape. Then the player will start throwing after a couple of weeks. <br><br>
                Eric makes the pitcher use a wearable to track the pitcher’s mechanics. See what to tweak to fix the throwing form and ultimately increase the velocity. Eric uses the app to put all this information in. He can then see trends and patterns which allow him to make data driven adjustments to the training moving forward.

            <h3>Scenario Three</h3>
            <p>
                Eric has been training his player, Jake, for almost 3 months. After checking his stats on the app Eric saw that his batting average and on base percentage had not improved in that time. Eric opens the app and checks out some of the video clips to see what is going on. He quickly finds out that the player’s mechanics needed to change. <br><br>Next training session they start from the beginning. Eric had Jake wear a wearable and made him swing at a ball off a tee. Then he transfers the information from the wearable to the app. Eric then uses that to see the players’ bat swing/bat pattern and from there they start tweaking the swing. <br><br>A couple weeks later, Eric has the pitcher recovering from tommy john to throw live BP to Jake. This allows Eric to see how Jake will do in a controlled game like environment. From there they see what else needs to be changed. Eric transfers all the data into the app for Jake to go back later and review.
