            <h3>Scenario One - Learning From the Pros</h3>
            <p>
                Andrew is a forward for the University of Alabama men's basketball team. The team has played in their first few games of the season, and at this point, each player has a general idea of how they rank among their teammates. Andrew has noticed that, while he’s been one of the best layup shooters on the team, he struggles a lot when shooting free throws. Compared to his peers on StatTrackr, he currently ranks 10th out of 14 when looking at the team’s free throw percentage. <br><br>His teammate Kyle, meanwhile, has been one of the strongest close-shooters on the team. He’s currently the third-best all-around shooter on the team, and he’s among the top 200 close-shooters on StatTrackr. Andrew noticed this, and asked Kyle one day after practice if he could help him with his free throws. <br><br>Kyle was glad to help, and gave Andrew some advice on how he can improve his aim. Afterwards, Andrew found himself shooting better thanks to Kyle’s advice, and became much better at close shooting. Over the next few weeks, Andrew’s average free throw percentage went up, and he ended the season ranking 5th out of 14 on StatTrackr.

            <h3>Scenario Two - The Big Game</h3>
            <p>
                One week, Andrew and his team heard from their coach that they were set to play the University of Tennessee that upcoming Saturday. Everyone on the team was pretty worried, as this was their second time playing Tennessee this season, and they had suffered a pretty hard loss during their first game. Andrew was especially nervous, as Tennessee had a really good shooter this year - he’d face some difficulty defending against him. <br><br>Before practice on Monday, Andrew went on StatTrackr and pulled up the cumulative stats of Tennessee’s team. On the team’s page, he could see both their overall stats, such as their three point percentage, and some videos from their most recent games. After looking at these stats, Andrew scrolled through the team’s roster to find their star shooter, and looked through his profile. Next to the shooter’s season statistics, his highlight reel showed some clips of his recent wins, which seemed to have been uploaded the night before. <br><br>Andrew watched these clips, and figured out that this shooter, while excellent when shooting threes from the front, usually struggled when shooting from the side. Knowing this, Andrew was able to create a thorough game plan for Saturday.

            <h3>Scenario Three - Totally Trending</h3>
            <p>
                It had been a great game for Andrew. Towards the end of the last quarter, the score was tied, and every member of the team was anxious. However, at the last minute, just when everyone thought Auburn was going to break the tie, Andrew grabbed a rebound off of an Auburn shot and ran it back to the other side of the court, dunking it in the net just before the buzzer went off. His team, who were lucky enough to film the whole thing, went wild! It was one of the greatest games he had ever played. <br><br>That next week, however, was the exact opposite. Within the first half of the game, Andrew not only managed to miss four shots, but also receive three fouls. As a result, he was benched for the rest of the game, which ended in a loss. He felt humiliated that night, and considered skipping practice the next day just so he wouldn’t have to see his teammates. <br><br>However, after he got home, he got a notification on StatTrackr. The video of his win, which he had uploaded the day after, had gotten so many likes that he was on the app’s weekly list of featured videos, showcasing it to everyone on StatTrackr. Knowing that so many other athletes thought he looked cool gave Andrew the confidence he needed, and helped him walk into practice the next day feeling ready to play.
