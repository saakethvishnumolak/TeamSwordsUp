            <h3>Scenario One - Comeback</h3>
            <p>
                During a key game, Alex is directing his son's basketball team. The squad is down at the break, and Alex needs to rethink his strategy. He wishes he had a sports tracking app that would enable him to instantly access comprehensive player performance information, shooting percentages, and the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition, assisting him in fine-tuning the team's strategy for a comeback in the second half.

            <h3>Scenario Two - Tryouts!</h3>
            <p>
                On a weekend, Alex is working with his kid and the younger members of the team in a tryouts period. He wants to monitor each player through the week of tryouts. He is using an id camp to help scout players and wants a sports tracking app to get real game statistics in order to analyze each player that he may be recruiting. Alex feels this app would get him more vital information in the recruitment process which can be crucial to narrowing down each player if they are struggling to decide who to get. <br><br>Once the coaching staff have a meeting to themselves analyzing this data in a spreadsheet etc., they feel they have important data to reject players. It is a lot easier to sit a player down and tell them where to improve for whichever team they decide to try out for next.

            <h3>Scenario Three - Post Game Pep Talk</h3>
            <p>
                After a game the previous weekend, when Alex is gathering his team for some post-match analysis, he wants to do a player specific session. He wants to monitor each person’s individual performance away from a team environment. He would use this information for post-game analysis. In order to adapt the coaching to help look at both the strengths and weaknesses of each player, a sport’s tracking app would be great for capturing performance data, from the likes of shooting ability to defensive blocks.
