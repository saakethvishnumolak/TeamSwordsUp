            <h3>Scenario 1 - Man Down!</h3>
            <p>
                Payton Worth is coach for the women’s swim team at the University of Michigan. Two days before the team’s next meet, she receives word that Maggie, one of her best breaststroke swimmers, had caught the flu and wouldn’t be able to swim that week. Payton is worried - Maggie had been set to swim in several heats, and it will be a struggle to find a replacement in time for the race. <br><br>She logs onto StatTrackr, and looks through her team’s stats to see who she can use to replace Maggie. Maggie was registered to swim in four races, and luckily, most of the other swimmers on the team had only signed up for two or three, leaving them free to swim in an extra race or two. Payton scrolls through the different types of recorded statistics, such as each player’s average backstroke time, before selecting on the breaststroke stats. Scrolling past the team’s average, she goes down the list of players and takes a note on her schedule sheet of the fastest girls on breaststroke, provided they could still do more races. <br><br>Outside of the app, she sends an email to each of these girls explaining the situation, and asking if they could take on Maggie’s races. Thankfully, all of the girls say yes, and UMich is able to compete in all of their races at the meet.

            <h3>Scenario Two - The New Girl</h3>
            <p>
                It’s the beginning of a new season for Payton Worth. After saying goodbye to her seniors back in the spring, she’s excited to welcome all of the new freshmen into her team, and see what kind of skills they’ll bring to the team. During the team’s first practice she passes around a piece of paper, and asks each of the new freshmen to either write down, or email her their basic information, such as their phone numbers, shirt sizes, and of course their StatTrackr ID numbers. Later that night, she goes through her list of new members, and adds them to the team’s digital roster by sending them an invite in the StatTrackr app. <br><br>However, she notices in one of her emails that one of the new members, Emma, stated that she didn’t have StatTrackr. Emma was a sophomore, who had recently transferred to UMiss from the University of Toledo. Emma explained in the email that Toledo had used Huddle as their main way of tracking stats, which meant that all of her performance data needed to be re-entered into StatTrackr. <br><br>At their next practice, Payton met with Emma and Maggie, who had helped Emma set up an account between practices. In the meeting, Maggie helped Emma navigate to her StatTrackr profile and find her ID number, so Payton could add her to the team. Additionally, Maggie went and showed both Payton and Emma how to import Emma’s old records from Huddle into StatTrackr, saving them both time and ensuring Emma’s information was up to date.

            <h3>Scenario Three - The Stroke Switch-Up</h3>
            <p>
                It’s a late night after a meet, and Payton is busy reviewing her team’s times from the race. She’s comparing the team’s latest times against their speed from the last game, when she notices that the data seems off. In one of the races that day, Daniella and Luisa - a pair of twins on the team - had competed in the same heat. <br><br>However, when comparing their times from today to their times from last week, both of their times seemed incredibly odd. Daniella, who was struggling with her backstroke time, had seemingly made a superhuman amount of progress in the past week, and had cut her time in half. Luisa, on the other hand, had hit a major setback, and took an extra ten seconds to complete what would normally be an easy race. <br><br>After reviewing the flyers and schedule she’d received at the meet today, Payton was pretty sure she knew what the issue was. In both of the documents, each player was listed by their first initial and last name. With only a letter serving as the difference between Daniella and Luisa’s scores, Payton figured it was likely that the two had accidentally entered each other's scores into StatTrackr, hence the odd data. She sent an email to the two to let them know about the potential mix up, and ask them to review the accuracy of their times. In the meantime, Payton went onto the team’s profile via her own account, and switched the two’s stats on her own. This ended up saving everyone’s time the next day, when the twins discovered that they had indeed gotten their scores mixed-up.
