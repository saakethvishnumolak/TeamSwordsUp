            <h3>Scenario One - Extra Work After Practice</h3>
            <p>
                Lily is in her second year as the head coach of the girls’ volleyball team in a small high school outside of Lexington. They are three weeks into practice and have their first game coming up in a week and a half. After practice on Friday, a girl came up to Lily and asked what she had to work on to get more playing time. <br><br> The girl was a junior, so she already had some stats from the previous year. Lily went into the history logs and checked her stats and saw what she was lacking in. She sees that the girl needs to improve her dig. <br><br>Lily sets up a drill for the girl and has her assistant coach film to check for form. Lily puts all the videos into the app which allows the girl to go back later and see what she needs to work on regarding her form.

            <h3>Scenario Two - Scout Team</h3>
            <p>
                Lily has gotten her team off to a very hot start. They have been winning a lot of games but not by much. They have their toughest opponent yet this coming Friday. Lily wants to use the app to scout the opponents line up. She watched the previous games and recorded the players’ season stats. She used them to create a projected lineup of who she thinks is going to start. She also made some notes about some bench players that have made an impact this year. <br><br>Starting that Monday leading up to the game, she pulled some of the bench players to the side and asked them to act as the scout team. The scout team played exactly like their opponents to emulate what they might do against them on Friday.

            <h3>Scenario Three - Midpoint Shakeup</h3>
            <p>
                Lily’s team is halfway through the season. They are coming up against the second ranked team in their division. Lily has run into a little dilemma this week as she is struggling with matchup problems. She was checking the opponents’ players stats on the app and found out that their best player, a top ranked center, has been dominating the competition. She checked her starting center’s stats and saw that she was not going to be a match against the other girl. <br><br>The following week of practices, Lily experimented with different lineups to see which best matches up with their opponent that week. She found that a center on the bench matched better for the upcoming game and figured out a rotation that worked for her and the team.
