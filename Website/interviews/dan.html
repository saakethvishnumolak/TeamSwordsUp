        <p class="question">What features would you like to see in a stat tracking app?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>As a trainer:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I would like to have access to all the players and team stats. I would also like to see all the games in the app too, so the stats of the players aren’t skewed. </li>
                        <li>I would also like to see all the major stat categories (The exact same box scores you can find on espn.com). This will help me see how my player performs overall instead of just focusing on a general topic like offense or defense.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>As a former coach:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Shot charts are very helpful. They make it easier to see a player’s shooting accuracy and hot spots on the court.</li>
                        <li>A rank of the players in the lineup based on different stats was very helpful as it showed which players we needed to focus on defensively and who to exploit offensively. Comparing the stats with a head-to-head matchup view is very helpful with this as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">Any design specifications?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Needs to be easy to use. I am not a genius when it comes to technology. I use an iPad for EVERYTHING, so I need something that is simple and does the job on that iPad. </li>
                <li>It would be cool to see video clips of some plays in a game on the app. Even though I will see everything when I train my players, it would be nice to see how they play in games. Games are different than practice.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">I get why you would need a stat tracker as a coach, how does an app like this help a trainer?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>A stat tracker helps me identify where players need improvement. Like I said, practice is very different compared to a game. I could have a player like Lebron James in training but then in games he is nowhere to be found. I would never know that without seeing game statistics or film. I can then focus on improving specific skills like mimicking in game pressure.</li>
                <li>I could also see other players’ stats. If a player I am training, comes up to me and says he has a big game coming up and he wants me to help him. I can scout the opponents he is playing and work on some drills that will help him against that team/player. Video clips would be very helpful here. If I see how an opponent plays, I can see some of their tendencies and I can counter that and teach my player how to attack that.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">How would an app like this help you when you were a coach?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>An app also shows patterns where players are playing well and shows where teamwork needs to be improved. Even though I can see this with my own two eyes during practice and games, the stats reiterate what you can see.</li>
                <li>We had somebody take the stats down on paper when I was coaching. It would have been much easier to see everything in one place. Nevertheless, we usually got the opposing teams player stats/lineups. I would base the starting line up on what we were going up against. I would play certain players that best matched up with the opposing players. This app would just make everything easier.</li>
            </ul>
