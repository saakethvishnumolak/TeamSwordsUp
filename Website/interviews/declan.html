        <p class="question">What features would you like to see in a stat tracking app?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Comprehensive stats:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Include standard statistics such as goals, assists, shots on target, passes completed, tackles, interceptions, and fouls committed. Advanced metrics like Expected Goals (xG), Key Passes, and Successful Dribbles can provide a better insight for analysis.</li>
                        <li>Cover team statistics like possession percentage, pass accuracy, shots on goal, corners won, and defensive stats such as clean sheets and goals conceded.</li>
                        <li>Provide live statistics during matches, including possession percentage, shots, fouls, and cards. He went on to say this helps his team prepare line ups and formations to gain that advantage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Real time updates:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ensure real-time tracking of matches, with instant updates on goals, assists, cards, substitutions, and other crucial events. This helps his assistant monitor substitutions throughout a game.</li>
                        <li>Offer updates on individual player statistics as the game progresses. As a coach he would want to know how players are contributing to the team's performance moment by moment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>User friendly interface:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to navigate seamlessly between player, team, and game statistics. Clear icons and an easy-to-use menu enhance the overall experience that his coaching staff can use daily.</li>
                        <li>Optimize the interface for mobile devices, which helps his team whilst they would be travelling long distances via coach/plane.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Historical data:
                    <ul>
                        <li>As a coach he can explore the historical performance of players and teams, including past seasons' statistics, goal-scoring trends, and player transfer histories. This can also be used for the recruitment of D1 athletes.</li>
                        <li>Implement tools for coaches to compare current player and team performance with historical data. This could involve visualizations, graphs, and trends over different seasons. He went on to say even though there is video analysis this would be an even bigger benefit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
