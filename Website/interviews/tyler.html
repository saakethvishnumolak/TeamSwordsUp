        <p class="question">What would you like to see in a stat tracking app?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Other team stats:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Would like an app to see other swimmers’ times, meets, and rankings. Furthermore, you can include stats like personal best times, intervals, splits, pace, stroke count, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Personal use:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be allowed to upload videos of my own workouts/races to help keep a detailed log for training sessions. Also, be allowed to see opponents’ films. I can use this to improve and analyze distance, time, and stroke techniques.</li>
                        <li>Data synchronization - Be compatible with wearables, like a smartwatch or fitness trackers, and be able to gather additional data to help see more analytics. (Heart rate, pace, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Video Library – be able to save some videos to be able to go back to them and reference them repeatedly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">Any design specifications?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Please make sure it is easy to use. Don’t make it too complicated to the point where it becomes more of a hassle to use than it helps.</li>
                <li>If possible, try to optimize the app to use on mobile devices. It will be easier for me to record and use while swimming.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">How do you think this app is going to help you improve?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>The app can help me become more consistent and disciplined with my training. I can also see my competition which can motivate me to work harder to be the best and win. I can improve my techniques and times using the statistics and film provided through the app. I can also see how my stroke evolves over time.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">How do you plan on using this app along with other coaching?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>My coach is in favor of technology in his teachings. He will be made aware of this app and will integrate it into the training plan. It is an invaluable addition to my in-person coaching. I will be able to use the app during solo workouts and then I could have my coach review it to make adjustments and improvements to the training regimen. This will be a tool to SUPPORT training, not REPLACE it.</li>
            </ul>
