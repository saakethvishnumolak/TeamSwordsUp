    <div class="about">
        <p>Tomas is a former soccer player at Bellarmine University and is from Santiago, Chile. He has got experience in professional soccer with Michigan stars and is now playing in Dallas, Texas. Tomas has great credentials in soccer and therefore makes him an ideal candidate to interview.</p>

    <div class="interview">
        <div class="question">What features would you like to see in a stat tracking app?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Heatmapping:
                    <ul>
                        <li>As a striker it could be beneficial for a heatmapping to provide a visual representation of a player’s positioning and movement on the soccer field during a game or session. Tomas went on to say this could aid his performance by seeing if he is in the right position when it comes to chances created therefore this gives him the best chance possible when it comes to scoring goals on the field. You could use hot and cold heatmaps to help differentiate when Tomas is in the right position that can be referred to when doing team video analysis for his professional soccer team.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Injury prevention:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tomas went on to say injury prevention tracking could be something that we could look to implement within our tracking app. This would help monitor a player's workload, including distance covered and intensity. It would then assess fatigue levels and alert players when they may be at risk of injury. This is very important in the modern game and helping keeping a player fit is essential at top level support so I felt this would be a great addition for our app. Tomas mentioned within the interview that load management could be another detail that could be implemented within our app. Injury prevention features can help both the playing and coaching staff  help manage a player’s load, ensuring they are up to the right fitness to perform better and ultimately this would help Tomas in his soccer career.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Customization:
                    <ul>
                        <li>This was Tomas’s 3rd feature that he felt could benefit him in his sporting performance context. This would help him set personalized goals and benchmarks through this app. This would help him with individual traits as a striker such as improving sprint speed or endurance which would help aid his performance and take him to the next level. He went on to say that soccer is a game of fine margins, and these details could help him make that next jump up in the soccer ranking. This customization could also help him set training plans ensuring that he follows a tailored regimen. This would give him lots of freedom within the app and add another dimension that Tomas feels we should consider whilst moving forward with the StatTrackr app.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Overall, I already knew Tomas on a personal level so this was very straightforward to set up this call via zoom and was a great insight into an ex professional athlete. Tomas knows what it’s like to perform on the highest stage and therefore I feel his answers were very beneficial and is something we can seriously consider whilst moving forward with this app.</p>
