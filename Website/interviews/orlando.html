        <p class="answer">
            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Students record it - “Film” (Tactic)</li>
                <li>Huddle - App</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Familiar - used in high school, and players typically keep it throughout college.</li>
                <li>Keeps a record of high school stats  - incredibly useful for trying out for college teams.</li>

        </p>

        <p class="question">What’s something about this tool that you wish could be improved? What are its current shortcomings?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Not a frequent user - position doesn’t really require statistics to be heavily tracked.</li>
                <li>Huddle is fine - coaches do most of the monitoring, and makes judgements based off of data on how to improve.</li>
            </ul>
