## What are the potential features, functions, or other important details that would be appealing to customers, end users or buyers?

Sporting performance is becoming increasingly about data and stats which is becoming a fundamental component of any sports team. This tracker would be used to boost performance from the data they receive to tailor training and focus on their strengths and weaknesses. This is used in many sporting teams around the globe and there is a need for this market in collegiate sports teams. We could make community integration for the app that could be unique for different sports teams throughout a college environment. We could use customization to make it unique and tailored to the needs of different sports teams. We could offer pricing flexibility that caters to a wide range of users and could use sponsorship for collegiate athletes as a way of cutting down the cost whilst also promoting their school name.
